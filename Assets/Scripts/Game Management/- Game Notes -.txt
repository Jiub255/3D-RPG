        Finish Loot System. 


        Clicking while in UI "loads up" an attack which goes off once you go back to the game. 
            Need to disable movement controls or make a new UI state.

        FIGURE OUT BUG.
            Changed movement action map actions from hold interaction to none, and all their events as performed instead of started or canceled.
            Got rid of the ugly fix stuff in GameManager.DisableActionMap. 
            Pretty much works now, except you need to press attack before it all works for some reason. NOT ANYMORE. 
            Changed move interaction to Press on release, and use started and performed to turn _moving on and off. Works for movement. 
            Made new state machine, same as old except uses plain c# classes instead of SO's. 
                Basically back to where I started though. 
                Want to try using the PlayerControls script interfaces (at the end of the script) to give each state class
                    only the action maps it needs, and only implement the methods it needs. 
                Hopefully since a new class is being created each time you switch, there won't be any need to disable or
                    re-enable the actions, which is what is causing all this trouble. SADLY NOT THE CASE. 
            Not sure how to use the interfaces yet, but doing the old ugly fix is only throwing one error instead of six, and 
                it fixes it the same it seems. 
                The error is: 
                    "Must not destroy InputActionState while executing an action callback within it
                    UnityEngine.InputSystem.InputAction:Dispose ()", 
                which comes from InputManager.DisableActionMap calling
                    PC.Movement.MovePlayer.Dispose();
                    PC.Movement.Melee.Dispose();
                    PC.Movement.Interact.Dispose(); 


        Make more things in the states into separate plain c# classes. Helps organize and clean up the code. 
            Like how SOPlayerMovementState makes a PlayerMovementAnimation instance to deal with animation. 


        Combat System: 
        General Setup:
            Player state machine: Movement, Attack, and Knockback states. 
            Enemy state machine: Idle, Movement, Attack, Knockback, and dead states. 
            One melee attack
                Separate identical animations for player and enemy to each call their CheckForHits method. 
            One get hit animation
            Get knocked back by enemy attacks
            Knock back enemies
        Still TODO:
            Copy loot system from BetterRPG. But make it better. 
            Add left hand animations/controls. 
            Magic spells in each hand. 


        Audio:
            Keep audio listener on player and put audio sources for sfx on the object that makes the noise so it sounds 3D.
                Not sure it'll work, if not can keep audio listener on active camera? 
                    Volume will be consistent, but not 3D at all. 
            How to manage volume? Different kind of audio manager? 

        Make it possible to equip two weapons. Have strong damaging weapons with weak knockback, like swords, and low damage 
            but high knockback weapons, like maces. 
            Make right click -> right hand weapon and left to left. So you can control which weapon to swing and be strategic. 
            Can also equip a spell in either hand, not just limited to weapons. 
            Have a few well designed, unique spells/weapons, not heaps of boring similar random loot. Like Zelda, not Diablo. 


        Make a random cloud spawner in the skybox object.
            Spawn random cloud, 
            Cloud goes across skybox area,
            Destroy (or disable) cloud. 
        Maybe do it in the normal gameworld instead. Looks kinda weird when you zoom out and the clouds stay the same.
            Make the clouds transparentable?
            Or just keep them high enough that the camera never goes above them. Probably this. 
        Set the clouds to not cast or recieve shadows (not recieving might not be necessary). 


        Morrowind style menu
            Separate resizable/movable windows for:
                Inventory/Equip - Inventory with tabs for different types of stuff
                Map - Local and global. Maybe make map a separate menu. 
                Character Page - Stats, class, skills, etc. 
                Quests/Journal?
                Magic/Mental stuff?
            Make map a separate menu? 
            OR, have esc bring up the menu as you last left it, but if you push m, then it opens the same except the map is on top.
                Same goes for other keys for other menus, i for inv etc. 
            Inventory/Items
                Types of items:
                    Weapon/Armor
                    Usable (like potions)
                    Tools
                    Magic stuff
                    Misc?
            Make it so when you click on an item it gets used/equipped (instead of having to drag and drop it on your character)
                Have left click drop it? Or set it to the mouse cursor so you can choose where to put it?
                Or just do it straight Morrowind style?


        Either pause time in dialog, or make it so attacks take you out of dialog. 
            Pausing for now. Might want to do something else later so the characters still do their idle animation and 
                trees sway and stuff while you're in dialog. 
                Maybe just freeze the enemies somehow?

        Character movement
            3rd person
            Changeable camera angle
            Done using NavMeshAgent.velocity instead of Rigidbody.MovePosition.
                Helps with knockback control, not falling through the ground, and not letting enemies push you around with their colliders. 
                Much better than rigidbody style. 

        Camera
            Rotate camera with mouse
            Zoom with mouse wheel

        Combat
            Basic state machine set up with Movement and Attack states. Still some bugs. 
            Melee attack and get hit on goblin enemy functional. 

        UI
            Inventory menu
            Equipment menu
            Stats menu

        Dialog
            Uses Inkle. Going to fully redesign the look, but the functionality is there. 
            Separate dialog camera over the player's shoulder to have a better view. 
                Should I put an AudioListener on it and switch it on when switching between cameras?
                Will the sound not sound right if I don't or will it matter? 
            Make a separate dialog camera that's closer up and aims at whoever you're talking to. Then make a decent dialog UI to go with it. 
                Make dialog camera object have its own audio listener and switch that too? Or does it matter? 
                Or put the audio listener on the player? And have sounds come from their proper source to get 3D sound? 
            Keep audio listener on player, and have each object that makes a sound be the source, so that it sounds 3d. 
                Need a whole different audio manager for this. How to control volume? Interfaces? Events? 
            ON THE PLAYER FOR NOW.

        Environment
            Sun with directional light orbits separate Skybox camera. 
                Gives day/night cycle effect with direction light and sun rotating around origin.
                Set sun's initial position to where it should be at noon based on distance and angle.
                    Also start the gametime at noon, 43200 seconds. 

            Put all navigation static objects in the "Navigation Static Objects" child object of Environment.
                Go to Window/Navigation Static Setter and click the button to set all children, grandchildren, etc to navigation static. 

        Items
            Can pick up items from the ground and they go into your inventory. 
            Usable items can be used and have whatever effect. 
                For each new effect, just make a new SO class that extends SOEffect, and have it override ExecuteEffect and
                    send an event to whichever script needs to hear it. 
            Equipment items can be equipped and stats are changed accordingly. 

        Stats System
            SO stat system, controlled by StatManager. 
            Each stat has its own list of modifiers affecting it (so far only modified by equipment, but could do other things later). 

        Have a "Scene Setup" object in every scene with the SceneSetup script attached. 
            Instantiates:
                Player
                Cameras object
                UI object
            Starts scene music. 

        Animated Skybox object on its own layer, and a skybox camera that only sees that layer. 
            Have sun at angle orbiting starting at z = 800.
            Going to make random cloud spawner in a radius less than that so the sun will always be behind the clouds,
                or I could make another camera and another layer and make sure the sun is rendered behind the other layers.

        OverlapBox wasn't detecting enemy hits, because the collider was on a child object of the rigidbody's object. 
        FIXED BY MOVING COLLIDER TO THE SAME OBJECT AS RIGIDBODY. 


        State machine:
            Player not moving if movement button held while entering MovementState. 
                _movePlayerAction.ReadValue<Vector2>() is returning zero vector after coming back to movement state with movement held down. 
                How to fix it?
                Problem only happens if you're holding move while you attack. If you start an attack while not moving, then hold move while you 
                    switch back to the movement state it works fine. 
        FIXED BY CALLING movePlayerAction.Dispose();. CAUSES ERROR WARNINGS BUT THEY SEEM HARMLESS. 
            Attack input not working on first click after entering MovementState, but works on second click every time. 
                Not sure why yet. 
                Changing the input from started to canceled fixed it. 
                    Probably because the action map gets disabled so it never got a chance to reach canceled, which is why
                        you had to push it again after entering movement state to let it finally reach a canceled state and reset. 
                    Not sure why doing _meleeAction.Reset() didn't work though. 
        ORIGINALLY FIXED BY CHANGING THE INPUT FROM STARTED TO CANCELED. 
        FIXED BY CALLING meleeAction.Dispose();. CAUSES ERROR WARNINGS BUT THEY SEEM HARMLESS. CHANGED INPUT BACK TO STARTED SO 
            NOW YOU CAN CONTINUALLY ATTACK IF YOU HOLD DOWN THE ATTACK KEY. 
            Both have something to do with the first click not registering after entering MovementState. 
                If you click first when entering state, then keep move held and click again, sometimes you'll keep moving 
                    after reentering movement state. But sometimes not, no idea why. 
        Bug fix for input actions not registering first push after disabling/reenabling action map seems to have caused the UI 
            action map to stop working. 
        FIXED BY CALLING S.I.IM.PC.Enable(); AFTER DISPOSING OF THE MOVEMENT ACTIONS IN SoAttackState. 
        TRY UPDATING UNITY/THE INPUT SYSTEM AND SEE IF THE BUGS ARE FIXED YET. IDEALLY BETTER FIX THAN THIS ONE WITH THE WEIRD ERRORS. 


        Character controllers weren't getting their references from characters because they were being gotten before _SOState.Awake(), 
            where the _runner reference is grabbed. 
        FIXED BY GETTING REFERENCES AFTER BASE.AWAKE.
